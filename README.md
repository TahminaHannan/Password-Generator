# Password-Generator

## About this project
Create an application that anyone can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code.

When the button is clicked there is a series of prompts for the password criteria:
- Length of password (at least 10 characters but no more than 64)
- Lowercase
- Uppercase
- Numeric
- Special characters
